    <p>Lumpia or <em>Lumpiang Shanghai</em> is a Filipino-style spring roll made of ground pork, 
        chicken or beef filling wrapped in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers. It's traditionally enjoyed with a choice of 
        dipping sauces such as sweet and sour, banana ketchup, and sweet chili.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken or pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (8 ounces) water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and shredded</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>20 pieces spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, 
            water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
        <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about 3/4-inch thick.
            Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
        <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, 
            for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. 
            Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
